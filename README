this is for the fakerate and uncertainty calculation

we calculate the fakerate for b jets and light jets using Sample 1 and Sample 2 from GJet MC/Data. The formula and uncertainty can be found in FrHistoCal in CalFR.cpp

for the background prediction, what we are actually using is the weighted fakerate of b jets and light jets, weighted with b jet fractions in QCD 0tag/1tag. And the calculation of weighted fakerate can be found in FrHistoCalTot in CalFR.cpp

The fakerate.pdf contains detailed calculation of the fakerate and uncertainty

One example (Cut1) is provided under the example directory. To run it:
   cd example
   root -l example.cpp
